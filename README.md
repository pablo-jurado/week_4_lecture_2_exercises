# week_4_lecture_2_exercises

All files should be located in a Github repo called `week_4_lecture_2_exercises` before the start of the next class session. If you do not finish all of the questions and exercises, then submit what you have completed. Do not miss a submission date!

Once all of the files have been managed through Git and Github, submit a link to the Github repository at the bottom of this page and add any notes, concerns or thoughts in the notes field.
